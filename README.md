# Compton-Credits-Guide
A comprehensive guide to everyone credited on Dr. Dre's third and final studio album.

<em>Compton</em> (also known as <em>Compton: A Soundtrack by Dr. Dre</em>) is the third and final studio album from self-made corporate billionaire and hip-hop recording artist Dr. Dre. This highly anticipated release was put together throughout the filming of the critically acclaimed movie, Straight Outta Compton.

Dre's self-described "grand finale" album was made possible by the collaborative efforts from a large and wide array of artists and musical producers alike. This extensive guide goes through every individual who received any kind of credit for the album and assesses their contribution as well as their past and future and much more.
